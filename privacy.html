            Privacy Policy:
            We recommend adding a Privacy Policy to your LittleLink. Adding one can help you stay compliant 
            with different privacy legislation and can also help set expectations for your site visitors.

            This is a boilerplate, what is here may not be applicable to you. By default, we give three sections...

            Analytics: where you can add links to analytic services.

            Content From External Platforms: This could be used for CDN services or additional buttons like GitHub hotlinkable buttons.

            Hosting and Backend Infrastructure: For where you host your LittleLink.

            You can remove, edit, and add to these as necessary for your project.

            <b>Legal basis for the processing of personal data</b>
            <br />
            Below we inform you about the legal basis for the processing of personal data:
            <br />
            <br />
            If we have obtained your consent for the processing of personal data, Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR is the legal basis. If the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures that are carried out at your request, Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. b) GDPR is the legal basis. If processing is necessary for the fulfilment of a legal obligation to which we are subject (e.g. statutory retention obligations), Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. c) GDPR is the legal basis. If processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person, Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. d) GDPR is the legal basis. If the processing is necessary to protect our or a third party's legitimate interests and your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms do not override this, Art. 6 (1) S. 1 lit. f) GDPR is the legal basis.

            <b>Disclosure of personal data to third parties and processors</b>
            <br />
            As a matter of principle, we do not pass on any data to third parties without your consent. Should this nevertheless be the case, then the disclosure is made on the basis of the aforementioned legal grounds, e.g. in the case of the disclosure of data to online payment providers for the fulfilment of a contract or due to a court order or because of a legal obligation to hand over the data for the purpose of criminal prosecution, to avert danger or to enforce intellectual property rights. We also use processors (external service providers e.g. for web hosting of our websites and databases) to process your data. If data is passed on to the processors as part of a contract processing agreement, this is always done in accordance with Art. 28 of the GDPR. In doing so, we select our processors carefully, monitor them regularly and have been granted a right to issue instructions regarding the data. In addition, the processors must have taken suitable technical and organisational measures and comply with the data protection regulations in accordance with the BDSG n.F. and the GDPR.

            <b>Data transmission to third party countries</b>
            <br />
            The adoption of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has created a uniform basis for data protection in Europe. Your data is therefore predominantly processed by companies to which the GDPR applies. However, if processing is carried out by services of third parties outside the European Union or the European Economic Area, these must meet the special requirements of Art. 44 et seq. GDPR. This means that the processing takes place on the basis of special guarantees, such as the officially recognised determination by the EU Commission of a level of data protection corresponding to the EU or the observance of officially recognised special contractual obligations, the so-called "standard contractual clauses". For US companies, submission to the so-called "Privacy Shield", the data protection agreement between the EU and the USA, fulfils these requirements.

            <b>Deletion of data and storage duration</b>
            <br />
            Unless expressly stated in this data protection declaration, your personal data will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose for storing it no longer applies, unless its continued storage is necessary for evidence purposes or is contrary to statutory storage obligations. This includes, for example, retention obligations under commercial law for business letters according to § 257 para. 1 HGB (6 years) as well as retention obligations under tax law according to § 147 para. 1 AO for receipts (10 years). When the prescribed retention period expires, your data will be blocked or deleted unless the storage is still necessary for the conclusion or fulfilment of a contract.

            <br />
            For security reasons, we store this data in server log files for a period of days. After this period, they are automatically deleted, unless we need to keep them for evidence purposes in the event of attacks on the server infrastructure or other legal violations.
