            Privacy Policy:
            We recommend adding a Privacy Policy to your LittleLink. Adding one can help you stay compliant 
            with different privacy legislation and can also help set expectations for your site visitors.

            This is a boilerplate, what is here may not be applicable to you. By default, we give three sections...

            Analytics: where you can add links to analytic services.

            Content From External Platforms: This could be used for CDN services or additional buttons like GitHub hotlinkable buttons.

            Hosting and Backend Infrastructure: For where you host your LittleLink.

            You can remove, edit, and add to these as necessary for your project.

            <b>Legal basis for the processing of personal data</b>
            <br />
            Below we inform you about the legal basis for the processing of personal data:
            <br />
            <br />
            If we have obtained your consent for the processing of personal data, Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR is the legal basis. If the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures that are carried out at your request, Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. b) GDPR is the legal basis. If processing is necessary for the fulfilment of a legal obligation to which we are subject (e.g. statutory retention obligations), Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. c) GDPR is the legal basis. If processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person, Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. d) GDPR is the legal basis. If the processing is necessary to protect our or a third party's legitimate interests and your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms do not override this, Art. 6 (1) S. 1 lit. f) GDPR is the legal basis.

            <b>Disclosure of personal data to third parties and processors</b>
            <br />
            As a matter of principle, we do not pass on any data to third parties without your consent. Should this nevertheless be the case, then the disclosure is made on the basis of the aforementioned legal grounds, e.g. in the case of the disclosure of data to online payment providers for the fulfilment of a contract or due to a court order or because of a legal obligation to hand over the data for the purpose of criminal prosecution, to avert danger or to enforce intellectual property rights. We also use processors (external service providers e.g. for web hosting of our websites and databases) to process your data. If data is passed on to the processors as part of a contract processing agreement, this is always done in accordance with Art. 28 of the GDPR. In doing so, we select our processors carefully, monitor them regularly and have been granted a right to issue instructions regarding the data. In addition, the processors must have taken suitable technical and organisational measures and comply with the data protection regulations in accordance with the BDSG n.F. and the GDPR.

            <b>Data transmission to third party countries</b>
            <br />
            The adoption of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has created a uniform basis for data protection in Europe. Your data is therefore predominantly processed by companies to which the GDPR applies. However, if processing is carried out by services of third parties outside the European Union or the European Economic Area, these must meet the special requirements of Art. 44 et seq. GDPR. This means that the processing takes place on the basis of special guarantees, such as the officially recognised determination by the EU Commission of a level of data protection corresponding to the EU or the observance of officially recognised special contractual obligations, the so-called "standard contractual clauses". For US companies, submission to the so-called "Privacy Shield", the data protection agreement between the EU and the USA, fulfils these requirements.

            <b>Deletion of data and storage duration</b>
            <br />
            Unless expressly stated in this data protection declaration, your personal data will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose for storing it no longer applies, unless its continued storage is necessary for evidence purposes or is contrary to statutory storage obligations. This includes, for example, retention obligations under commercial law for business letters according to § 257 para. 1 HGB (6 years) as well as retention obligations under tax law according to § 147 para. 1 AO for receipts (10 years). When the prescribed retention period expires, your data will be blocked or deleted unless the storage is still necessary for the conclusion or fulfilment of a contract.

            <br />
            If you only use our website for informational purposes (i.e. no registration and no other transmission of information), we only collect the personal data that your browser transmits to our server. If you wish to view our website, we collect the following data:

            This data is not stored together with other personal data about you.<br />
            <br />
            This data serves the purpose of user-friendly, functional and secure delivery of our website to you with functions and content as well as its optimisation and statistical evaluation.<br />
            <br />
            The legal basis for this is our legitimate interest in data processing, which also lies in the above purposes, in accordance with Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR.<br />
            <br />
            For security reasons, we store this data in server log files for a period of days. After this period, they are automatically deleted, unless we need to keep them for evidence purposes in the event of attacks on the server infrastructure or other legal violations.

            <b>Settlement of contracts</b>
            <br />
            We process inventory data (e.g. company, title/academic degree, names and addresses as well as contact data of users, e-mail), contract data (e.g. services used, names of contact persons) and payment data (e.g. bank details, payment history). bank details, payment history) for the purpose of fulfilling our contractual obligations (knowledge of who is a contractual partner; justification, content and processing of the contract; checking the plausibility of the data) and services (e.g. contacting customer service) in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit b) GDPR. The entries marked as mandatory in online forms are required for the conclusion of the contract.<br />
            <br />
            As a matter of principle, this data is not passed on to third parties unless it is necessary for the pursuit of our claims (e.g. transfer to a lawyer for debt collection) or for the fulfilment of the contract (e.g. transfer of data to a payment provider) or there is a legal obligation to do so pursuant to Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. c) GDPR.<br />
            <br />
            We may also process the data you provide to inform you about other interesting products from our portfolio or to send you emails with technical information.<br />
            <br />
            The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required to achieve the purpose for which it was collected. This is the case for inventory and contract data when the data is no longer required for the performance of the contract and claims can no longer be asserted under the contract because they are time-barred (warranty: two years / standard limitation period: three years). We are obliged by commercial and tax law to store your address, payment and order data for a period of ten years. However, we restrict processing after three years if the contract is terminated, i.e. your data is only used to comply with legal obligations. Details in the user account remain until it is deleted.

This is the case if the processing is not necessary, in particular, for the fulfilment of a contract with you, which is shown by us in each case in the following description of the functions. When exercising such an objection, we ask you to explain the reasons why we should not process your personal data as we have done. In the event of your justified objection, we will review the merits of the case and either cease or adapt the data processing or show you our compelling legitimate grounds on the basis of which we will continue the processing.<br />
